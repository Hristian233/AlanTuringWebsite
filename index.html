					The Turing test is a test which shows if a machine's conduct can be as intelligent as a human's or indiscernibly intelligent from a human's.<br> 
					Alan Turing suggested that a judge would evaluate a dialogue between a human and a machine in their natural tongue, 
					whereas the machine's concept is to generate human-like responses.<br><br>  
					Whoever would evaluate, would be taken under consideration that there a two participants and one of them is a machine. However the participants will be split from each other.
					The means for the conversation will be limited to texting only, which means the conversation would involve a computer keyboard and a screen. 
					This makes the assessment independable from the machine's skills for rendering words as speech.<br><br>  
					Anyways if the assessor is not completely sure about  the difference between the machine and the human the machine is considered to have passed the test 
					(according to Alan Turin the machine would persuade a human around 70% of the time in about five minutes after the conversation has started).<br> 
					However the point of the whole test is not to verify if a machine has the ability of giving correct answer, 
					but to see how similiar the answer would be to a one given by human.<br> 
					Alan Turing represented the test for the first time in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" from 1950.<br>  
					During this time he was working at The University of Manchester.
					The opening words of his paper are: "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'" because "thinking" is difficult to define.<br>  
					Turing chooses to "replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words. 
					"Turing's new question is: "Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?".<br>  
					This is question which Turing actually belived is answerable.<br> 
					The first introducer of the test was Turing himself.<br>  
					The test is considered to be both really influencing and really criticised and is now an important idea in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.
