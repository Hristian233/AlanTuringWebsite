					<h3>Strengths</h3>
				    <p>
					For strengths and weaknesses there is one major strength, which is mentioned when you look up the term “turing test”: the simplicity of the test itself.<br>
					Many other sections of science crave a definition of intelligence, simple as that through the test an actual definition isn’t made, 
					but we can compare the results and therefore we can use those results as a grading of intelligence.<br> Made to test machines, 
					it is actually not designed to determine intelligence as itself, but to see if a machine can behave like a human. 
					This can be either strength or a weakness for the test. Strength of the test as designed by Allan Turing is, 
					that the test itself can be expanded in many ways, as to test for vision, or even motion.<br> What Allan Turing also really wanted to test for, 
					was emphasis or if the machine could make up feelings and opinions based on feelings, for example, when being told a sad story.
					</p>
					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<p>
					The weaknesses of the test are that it is not testing for intelligence as it is, but for human and intelligent behavior. 
					There are many different things that would come to mind as intelligent behavior, which a human would never do. 
					For example in the TV-Series “The Big-Bang-Theory” main character Sheldon Cooper mostly behaves very cryptic and socially unskilled, 
					even if he probably is the smartest (most intelligent) person in the room. 
					This is the thought that comes to mind if I think about intelligent behavior which just isn’t human and thus not asked for in the Turing test.<br> 
					For the other side, emotions like love compassion and anger don’t follow “intelligent” reasoning too much and can’t be tested for.
					</p>
					<p>
					The truth is, with our tools and methods nowadays we really can’t define consciousness, 
					or even intelligence therefore it’s not the fault of the test for being imprecise or faulty, but a lack of information, 
					that can’t be put into such a test. With those thoughts given, the strengths of the test might be its biggest weaknesses.
					</p>
