				<h2>Versions of the Turing Test</h2>
				<hr>		
				<div class="boxMain_content">				
					<p>
					According to Saul Traiger there are at least three versions of the Turin test, 
					one of them is called "Standard Interpretation" and the other two are offered in "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".<br> 
					There is also an argue about the three versions of the Turing machines and more specifically that they 
					shouldn't be considered equivalent and that they have different strengths and weaknesses.                                            
					Huma Shah stated that Turing himself didn't know for sure if a machine can think and decided to test this, 
					using a simple method: the test involved human-machine question-answer sessions.<br>
					The Turing test is actually a test about indistinguishability in performance capacity the verbal version which 
					generalises in a natural way to a  human's performance capacity, verbal as well as nonverbal (robotic).
					</p>
					<h3>Imitation Game</h3>
					<p>
					The original game of Turing involved three participants and was a simple party game.<br> 
					The three participants - A, B and C were a man, a woman and C was the interrogator -  whether a man or a woman . 
					Players A and B remain hidden from C and C can only communicate with them using written notes. C's goal is to define which of them is the man and which is the woman. 
					While playing the game A tries to trick C and lead it to the wrong conclusion and B is trying to help C making the right decision.<br> 
					Turing proposed the role of A to be taken by a computer and to pretend it's a woman in order to trick the interrogator to make a wrong decision. 
					The computer's success was defined by making a comparison between the result of the game when A is a computer and the result of the game when A is a man.<br><br>
					According to Turing if the questioner makes the same amount of mistakes with a computer as he makes with a man or a woman the computer is considered intelligent. 
					The second version of the game was brought to light in Turing's 1950 paper. 
					The game was very similar to the Original Imitation Game Test, where a computer performs the role of participant A. 
					But B's role is however played by a  man not by a woman 
					Standard interpretation
					General belief brings up  the point that the Turing test is not about determining whether the computer can trick the questioner letting him think the it is a human, 
					but rather whether a computer could imitate a human.<br><br>
					According to some statements it is believed that this version interferes with the second one, 
					while according to other it doesn't - namely because this is the so-called standard interpretation, where A is a computer and B is whether a man or a woman. 
					The role of the questioner is to define which is the computer and which is the human, but not which is male and which is female.<br> 
					The general problem with the version standard interpretation is that the negotiator cannot distinguish the human from the machine. 
					There are issues about continuance, whereas this limitation is considered reasonable by the standard interpretation.
					</p>
					<h3>Imitation Game vs. Standard Turing Test</h3>
					<p>
					The different formulations of the Turing test have led to a Controversy. 
					Sterrett states that the two tests can be taken out of his 1950 paper and that they're not the same. 
					The "Original Imitation Game Test" is the test involving a party game and a result comparison.<br>
					Meanwhile the "Standard Turing Test" is the one involving human assessor and a conversation with a human and a machine.<br><br> 
					Sterrett also defines a huge difference between the STT and OIG. 
					Unlike the STT the OIG, does not make similarity to human performance the criterion, 
					even though it employs human performance in setting a criterion for machine intelligence.<br>
					A man can fail the OIG Test, but it was proofed that failure indicates a lack of resourcefulness: 
					What the OIG test requires is the intelligence and not merely "simulation of human conversational behaviour".<br>
					The general structure of the OIG Test could also be used with versions of imitation games, which are not verbal.
					Saygin's suggestion was that maybe the game which is original could be used for proposing a 
					design which is less biased experimental as it hides the participation of the computer.<br>
					A "social hack" is also included in the imitation game which is not to be found in the standard interpretation, 
					as in the game both male human and computer are required to play as pretending to be the what they are not.
